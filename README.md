# Godot_SaveGameManager

A simple example of a save game manager in Godot. (Autoload script)

The scripts in the "final-scripts" folder can be used in other godot projects. 

The SaveGame/SaveGameLoader scripts are independent from the ResourceLoader scripts (DirectoryLoaderStatic, DirectoryLoaderAsync, ResourceLoaderAsync). 

All the resource loader scripts should be used together.

Everthing in the "testing" folder is just there for testing how everthing works and is not meant to be used outside of this project.

I made these scripts for myself but I wanted to share them. I have tested them but I CAN NOT guarantee that they are bug free or have no unexpected behaviours.

Fell free to use them in any number of private/commercial projects.

If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to improve those scripts feel free to open an issue.

Thank you for reading this far and I hope these scripts help you in your projects:)
